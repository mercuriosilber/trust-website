title: "What does the error "insufficient gas * price + value" means?"
---

The gas fee is paid for miners in the Ethereum network to process a transaction.

There are two cases in which you can get this error:

1. Send Ether. You want to send tokens and don't have enough ETH to pay the gas fee. Send some ETH to your Trust Wallet to pay the gas fee.

2. Send token. If you want to send all the ETH you have in your Trust Wallet, you have to subtract the gas fee from the amount of ETH you are trying to send. For example, if you want to send 1 ETH, try to send a smaller amount (0.97 ETH etc.)
